Choose from a variety of naming conventions to suit your workflow:
* Permit the use of file names directly.
* Default to directory names, utilizing the parent directory's name for files.
* Adopt the name of the parent module.
* Use the parent module's directory name for a more structured approach.
* Consistently use the project's name for all terminal tabs.

*Pro-tip*: Enhance your efficiency by assigning a shortcut to the "Open In > Terminal" action, streamlining the process of opening terminals in your desired context.
